          <p class="paragraph-text">Over the past months, she have had the privile ge of engaging in various transformative experiences that have significantly shaped her professional journey. Kimi's involvement in events like AWS Community Day PH 2023, Campus DEVCON Summit, and IGNITE x Young Founders Summit Global 2023 provided me with invaluable opportunities to expand my network and deepen my understanding of the tech industry. These events allowed Kimi to connect with professionals, leaders, and fellow students, broadening my horizons and inspiring her to explore new avenues for growth and innovation. 
            Her participation in these events also honed her skills in leadership, event management, and community building, which have been pivotal in her development. 
            <br><br> As the Captain of AWS Cloud Club - PCU Cavite, she have had the honor of leading and organizing multiple successful events, including their inaugural technical workshop, Infrastructure Camp, and their academic year's final event, "Inspire to Aspire: AWSome Journey - A Leader's Path to Innovation and Growth." These experiences have strengthened her leadership abilities, particularly in coordinating with teams, managing challenges, and ensuring the successful execution of events. Kimi have also gained significant experience in public speaking, having overcome her fear of addressing large audiences, which has been a crucial milestone in her personal development.
          <br><br> Recently, on July 19, she was appointed as the Director of Marketing for AWS Cloud Club Philippines, marking a new chapter in her journey. This role presents an exciting opportunity to contribute to the broader AWS Cloud Club community in a more strategic capacity, building on the leadership and marketing skills she have developed. As she step into this new role, she is eager to collaborate with fellow captains and leads to drive their initiatives forward and continue fostering a vibrant and supportive tech community in the Philippines.</p>
